Needfinding User Point of View

Why would I physically find an official to authorize my request, when I could
request online and let an official authorize it there.(Citizen)

I could go directly to the hall to request a document, but it will take me a couple of
minutes, especially when they verify my data there.(Citizen)

Conducting a short and brief interview to persons requesting a document to verify their data will
consume a number of minutes, and it will be inconvinient to them. (Brgy. Clerk)

Being an official is only a part time job, how can i authorize someone requesting a document
when I am not always around? (Brgy. Official)
